# todo-web-jest-babel

## Reason
I decided to create this app to practice Unit Tests fundamentals. Todo App, I can tests several operations such as: create, update and remove. Then, to check if it works or not.

First of all, I choose Jest and Babel to start this project and get experience how to setup both libraries.

You can see a demo here: https://gorgeous-madeleine-d0d9f9.netlify.app/

### State Management
As I was practing unit tests, I took oportunity and choose Zustand to manage state to see how it works.

### ðŸ§ª Unit Tests

#### CreateTodo Component
- should create a new todo
- should not be able to create a new todo if input is empty

#### TodoItem Component
- should be able to mark todo as done
- should not show button actions if it is marked as done
- should be able to delete a todo
